In this analysis, I am looking at how to identify potential marine species habitat suitable for aquaculture through the use of spatial analysis of vector and raster data. Specifically, I look at habitat requirements across temperature and depth requirements for oysters.

**Note:** the data associated with this assignment is too large to include in the GitHub repo. Instead, download data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u-iwnPDbe6ZK7wSFVMI-PpCKaRQ3RVmg/view?usp=sharing). Unzip the folder and all the contents and store in your directory as follows. Don't include data when you submit your assignment!
